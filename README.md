React components to build interactive hexagons grids. It uses SVG which makes it fast, scalable and easy to apply custom styles. You can easily customize the layout of the grid just by configuration.

Component-based approach allows you to customize the grid shape to suit your needs or even apply your own components / SVG elements to it. You can use pre-defined generator to create certain grid shapes or you may build your own grid tas you wish, while still keeping it under control and interactive.

You could easily use this library to build a nice portfolio, image library or even a game (just to name a few)!

And remember, hexagons are the bestagons:

## v2 around the corner

The new version should not contain any breaking changes. There is typescript support, some storybook examples for easy development and testing. The new version uses the newer react context api under the hood.
Though there should not be any breaking changes, there could be issues. Feel free to checkout the current beta release and give feedback.

Install via:

```
npm install react-hexgrid@beta
```

## Pre-requisites

You should be familiar with Node + NPM, React and ES6 to use this library.
Library also depends heavily on HTML5 features (mostly SVG) which all might not be supported by every browser yet.
For example [Drag & Drop](http://caniuse.com/#search=drag%20and) is still quite heavily under work.

## Getting Started

Install it via npm:

```shell
npm install --save react-hexgrid
```

More documentation in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Hellenic/react-hexgrid/wiki).

## Example

```html
import { HexGrid, Layout, Hexagon, Text, Pattern, Path, Hex } from 'react-hexgrid';
import './App.css';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <HexGrid width={1200} height={800} viewBox="-50 -50 100 100">
          {/* Grid with manually inserted hexagons */}
          <Layout size={{ x: 10, y: 10 }} flat={true} spacing={1.1} origin={{ x: 0, y: 0 }}>
            <Hexagon q={0} r={0} s={0} />
            {/* Using pattern (defined below) to fill the hexagon */}
            <Hexagon q={0} r={-1} s={1} fill="pat-1" />
            <Hexagon q={0} r={1} s={-1} />
            <Hexagon q={1} r={-1} s={0}>
              <Text>1, -1, 0</Text>
            </Hexagon>
            <Hexagon q={1} r={0} s={-1}>
              <Text>1, 0, -1</Text>
            </Hexagon>
            {/* Pattern and text */}
            <Hexagon q={-1} r={1} s={0} fill="pat-2">
              <Text>-1, 1, 0</Text>
            </Hexagon>
            <Hexagon q={-1} r={0} s={1} />
            <Hexagon q={-2} r={0} s={1} />
            <Path start={new Hex(0, 0, 0)} end={new Hex(-2, 0, 1)} />
          </Layout>
          <Pattern id="pat-1" link="http://cat-picture" />
          <Pattern id="pat-2" link="http://cat-picture2" />
        </HexGrid>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Will look something like this (custom CSS applied):
