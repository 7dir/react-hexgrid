# Hooks
Ah, hooks.  The quintessential React feature that every React developer worth their salt knows how to use -
or at the very least, google how to use.  

Hooks are useful in react-hexgrid because they give us a way to manipulate a hexagon after it's been rendered.

An array of Hexes:

```js
const hexes: Hex[] = [new Hex(0,0,0), new Hex(0,1,0)];
```

is useless to us once it's been rendered.  It'll turn into some HTML like:

```HTML
<svg>
<g class="tutorial" transform="translate(randomnumbers)" draggable="true">
    <g class="hexagon">
        <polygon points="randomnumbers"></polygon>
    </g>
</g>
<g class="tutorial" transform="translate(randomnumbers)" draggable="true">
    <g class="hexagon">
        <polygon points="randomnumbers"></polygon>
    </g>
</g>
<g class="tutorial" transform="translate(randomnumbers)" draggable="true">
    <g class="hexagon">
        <polygon points="randomnumbers"></polygon>
    </g>
</g>
</svg>
```

Which is patently useless.  Sure, you could use CSS or HTML DOM selectors to pick and choose 
which hexagons you want to change, but then you wouldn't be able to use our useful HexUtils
to do cool things.  Which is why you need hooks!

From a 10,000 ft view, we use hooks to manipulate our array of hexagons, then render them again.

We're going to build something cool like this:

<Story of={HexagonStory.Hooks} />

Let's dive right in!

## Setting up

Import all the variables we're going to need, and set up the hooks:

```tsx

import {useState} from 'react';
import { HexGrid, GridGenerator, Hex, Layout, HexUtils } from "../"

const allHexagons: Hex[] = GridGenerator.hexagon(4);
const [hexagons, setHexagons] = useState<Hex[]>(allHexagons);

export default App () {

}
```

Note that we generate some hexagons using GridGenerator, and then make a state variable.  This'll be useful later.

Then, add this Layout tag inside of a HexGrid:

```tsx
import {useState} from 'react';
import { HexGrid, GridGenerator, Hex, Layout, HexUtils } from "../"

const allHexagons: Hex[] = GridGenerator.hexagon(4);
const [hexagons, setHexagons] = useState<Hex[]>(allHexagons);

export default App () {
      <HexGrid width="95vw" height="95vh">
            <Layout
                size={{ x: 6, y: 6 }}
                flat={false}
                spacing={1.1}
                origin={{ x: 0, y: 0 }}
            >
            </Layout>
      </HexGrid>
}
```

By making the `HexGrid` 95 vw and vh, it'll fill up most of the user's screen, without having scroll bars appear.
We can't use 100vw and vh, because when we do ugly scroll bars show up.

Next, inside the Layout tag, we set the size attribute 6 by 6, meaning that we can comfortably show up 
to 6 hexagons on the screen, effectively scaling our hexagons.  We also set the origin and spacing, because why not.

We're all set for the next part!

## Adding hexagons

Now, it's time to draw some hexagons!  Using the same App.css file we've been using this entire tutorial (I'll paste it here):

App.css:

```css
svg g.tutorial {
    stroke: black;
    stroke-width: 0.01em;
    fill: transparent;
}
```

We add this code to draw the hexagons:

```tsx
import {useState} from 'react';
import { HexGrid, GridGenerator, Hex, Layout, HexUtils } from "../"

const allHexagons: Hex[] = GridGenerator.hexagon(4);
const [hexagons, setHexagons] = useState<Hex[]>(allHexagons);

export default App () {
      <HexGrid width="95vw" height="95vh">
            <Layout
                size={{ x: 6, y: 6 }}
                flat={false}
                spacing={1.1}
                origin={{ x: 0, y: 0 }}
            >
                {hexagons.map((hex: Hex, i: number) => (
                    <Hexagon
                        key={i}
                        q={hex.q}
                        r={hex.r}
                        s={hex.s}
                        className={"tutorial"}
                    />
                ))}
            </Layout>
      </HexGrid>
}
```

You should see a good ol' familiar hexagon made out of other hexagons.
