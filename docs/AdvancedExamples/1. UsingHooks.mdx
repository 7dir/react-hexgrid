# Hooks
Ah, hooks.  The quintessential React feature that every React developer worth their salt knows how to use -
or at the very least, google howo to use.  

Hooks are useful in react-hexgrid because they give us a way to manipulate a hexagon after it's been rendered.

An array of Hexes:

```js
const hexes: Hex[] = [new Hex(0,0,0), new Hex(0,1,0)];
```

is useless to us once it's been rendered.  It'll turn into some HTML like:

```HTML
<svg>
<g class="tutorial" transform="translate(randomnumbers)" draggable="true">
    <g class="hexagon">
        <polygon points="randomnumbers"></polygon>
    </g>
</g>
<g class="tutorial" transform="translate(randomnumbers)" draggable="true">
    <g class="hexagon">
        <polygon points="randomnumbers"></polygon>
    </g>
</g>
<g class="tutorial" transform="translate(randomnumbers)" draggable="true">
    <g class="hexagon">
        <polygon points="randomnumbers"></polygon>
    </g>
</g>
```

Which is patently useless
