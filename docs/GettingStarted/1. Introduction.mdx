# react-hexgrid
`react-hexgrid` helps you create tessellations of regular hexagons without the headache of wrangling with SVGs.

It uses `<g>` and `<polygon>` tags to make regular hexagons - no fancy CSS tricks!  Your hexagons will be easy to read, style, and maintain.

There are also algorithms for generating common hexagon patterns.

Boasting 0 dependencies, full TypeScript support, Storybook visual tests, and a commitment to no breaking changes, any react-hexgrid code you write 
will last a long, long time.
