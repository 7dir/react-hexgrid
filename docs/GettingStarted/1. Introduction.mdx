`react-hexgrid` helps you create tessellations of regular hexagons without the headache of wrangling with SVGs.

It uses `<g>` and `<polygon>` tags to make regular hexagons - no fancy CSS tricks!  Your hexagons will be easy to read, style, and maintain.

There are also algorithms for generating common hexagon patterns.

Boasting 0 dependencies, full TypeScript support, Storybook visual tests, and a commitment to no breaking changes, any react-hexgrid code you write 
will last a long, long time.

### A note on styling

Throughout this documentation,  you may see some hexagons styled with inline styles.  Keep in mind
that using inline styles makes your code hard to maintain and error prone and is in fact a React anti-pattern!
I'm using inline styles just to make the code shorter and easier to understand - where possible, use 
classes and an App.css file.
