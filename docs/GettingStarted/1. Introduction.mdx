# react-hexgrid
`react-hexgrid` helps you create and maintain regular grids of hexagons without the headache of wrangling with SVGs.

It uses `<g>` and `<polygon>` tags to make regular hexagons - no fancy CSS tricks!  Your hexagons will be both readable and easy to style.

There are also algorithms for generating common hexagon patterns.

Boasting 0 dependencies and full TypeScript support, along with Storybook visual tests, you can be confident that any code you write will be lasting and maintainable.
