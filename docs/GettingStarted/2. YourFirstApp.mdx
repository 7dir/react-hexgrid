# Your First App

## Step 1: Create a new React app
Since `react-hexgrid` is just a component library, it doesn't care what you use to init your React app.  I'm partial to Vite:
```bash
npx create vite@latest my-hexgrid-app -- --template react-swc-ts
```

It doesn't matter if you use TypeScript or SWC - that's just my personal preference.

## Step 2: Install `react-hexgrid`

```bash
npm install github:@7dir/react-hexgrid#main
```

## Step 3: Write your first hexagon!

In `App.tsx`, delete all the random code and replace it with this:

```tsx
import { HexGrid, Layout, Hexagon } from 'react-hexgrid';
export default function App() {
  <HexGrid width="100%">
      <Hexagon q={0} r={0} s={0} className="tutorial"/>
  </HexGrid>
}
```

In `App.css`, add:

```css
svg g.tutorial {
    stroke: black;
    stroke-width: 0.01em;
    fill: transparent;
}
```

Run the app with `npm run dev` or your preferred package manager, and you should see a red hexagon in the middle of your screen.

  <Story of={HexagonStory.Default} />


### Step 4: Understanding how it works

The HexGrid component exports a simple SVG element with a couple of default props, such as viewbox.  
You can substitute your own svg tag with your own props if you'd like more control.  
Under the HexGrid tag, the Hexagon takes advantage of pre-existing algorithms to calculate the points
of a hexagon and then display them using the polygon tag.
