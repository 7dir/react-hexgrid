# The Pattern component
The Pattern component is a wrapper around the svg pattern tag,
which lets you compact assets like gradients and images into 
a single tag, reachable with a single ID!

# Usage

The Pattern component isn't visible, just like the `<pattern>` svg tag.  It only has three props 
(one optional): link (the link to your image), id (what you want to call your pattern), and size 
(which defaults to a square).

Try out this code:

```tsx
import { HexGrid, Hexagon, Layout, Pattern } from '@aaronzshey/react-hexgrid';
export default function App() {
  <HexGrid width="100%" height="100%">
    <Layout>
      <Pattern id="my-pattern" link="https://picsum.photos/200"/>
      <Hexagon q={0} r={0} s={0} fill="my-pattern"/>
    </Layout>
  </HexGrid>
}
```

<Story of={PatternStory.Default} />
Since `Pattern`s are just syntactic sugar over svg tags, they must be inside of an SVG or HexGrid tag.
However, they can either be inside or outside Layout tags - it's up to you!
