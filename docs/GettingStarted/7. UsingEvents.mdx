# Events

### Before we start, a quick disclaimer:

Don't use events to do simple things such as changing styles - use CSS instead.  Using `:hover` CSS 
rules are faster and easier to read.  Only use mouse events when you need access to Javascript utils.

Since this is just a simple example, we are going to change the styles of a hexagon, just to understand 
how events work.  But don't do that!  Do as I say, not as I do :).

Anyway, let's jump in!

Each `Hexagon` component exposes the full suite of React events you are used to: onMouseEnter, 
onMouseLeave, onClick, etc.  However, using these events is a little tricky! 

Feeling impatient?  Scroll all the way down to see the code all together!

Start with your code from your first app:

```tsx
import { HexGrid, Layout, Hexagon } from '@aaronzshey/react-hexgrid';
export default function App() {
  <HexGrid width="100%">
      <Hexagon q={0} r={0} s={0} cellStyle={{fill: "red"}}/>
  </HexGrid>
}
```

First, add the `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` events to the `Hexagon` component:

```tsx
<Hexagon 
  q={0} 
  r={0} 
  s={0} 
  cellStyle={{fill: "red"}}
  onMouseEnter={(e) => ()}
  onMouseLeave={(e) => ()}
  />
```

Next, we need to add some types (we are using typescript after all):

```tsx
<Hexagon 
  q={0} 
  r={0} 
  s={0} 
  cellStyle={{fill: "red"}}
  onMouseEnter={(e: React.MouseEvent<SVGElement, MouseEvent>) => ()}
  onMouseLeave={(e: React.MouseEvent<SVGElement, MouseEvent>) => ()}
  />
```

However, the type needs to be slightly different inside the function body:

```tsx
<Hexagon 
  q={0} 
  r={0} 
  s={0} 
  cellStyle={{fill: "red"}}
  onMouseEnter={(e: React.MouseEvent<SVGElement, MouseEvent>) => ((e.target as SVGElement))}
  onMouseLeave={(e: React.MouseEvent<SVGElement, MouseEvent>) => ((e.target as SVGElement))}
  />
```

By casting the event target to an SVGElement, we expose setters and getters
for attributes, which we're going to use now:

```tsx
<Hexagon 
  q={0} 
  r={0} 
  s={0} 
  cellStyle={{fill: "red"}}
  onMouseEnter={(e: React.MouseEvent<SVGElement, MouseEvent>) => ( (e.target as SVGElement).style.fill = "blue" )}
  onMouseLeave={(e: React.MouseEvent<SVGElement, MouseEvent>) => ( (e.target as SVGElement).style.fill = "red" )}
  />
```

And that's it!  Putting it all together,

```tsx
import { HexGrid, Layout, Hexagon } from '@aaronzshey/react-hexgrid';
export default function App() {
  <HexGrid width="100%">
      <Hexagon 
        q={0} 
        r={0} 
        s={0} 
        cellStyle={{ 
            fill: "red", 
            transition: "fill 0.1s" 
        }} 
        onMouseEnter={(e: React.MouseEvent<SVGElement, MouseEvent>) => 
            (e.target as SVGElement).style.fill = "blue"
        }s
        onMouseLeave={(e: React.MouseEvent<SVGElement, MouseEvent>) => 
            (e.target as SVGElement).style.fill = "red"
        }
      />
  </HexGrid>
}
```
