# react-hexgrid
`react-hexgrid` helps you create and maintain regular grids of hexagons without the headache of wrangling with SVGs.  

It's built on top of React SVG components, using tags like `<g>` and `<polygon>` to make regular hexagons.

The package distributes algorithms for generating patterns of hexagons, suitable for games, backgrounds, or anything else you can imagine!

Boasting 0 dependencies and full TypeScript support, along with transparent Storybook visual tests, you can be confident that any code you write will be lasting and maintainable.
