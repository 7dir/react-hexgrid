## What's a generator?

One of the most powerful features of `react-hexgrid` is its generator algorithms - helper functions
that can create patterns of hexagons for you.  These generators are simple and easy to use.

## Usage

Extended usage documentation can be found in the API documentation section of this Storybook.
Here's a basic example, using the HexagonGenerator:

```tsx
import { Hexagon, HexGrid, HexagonGenerator } from '@aaronzshey/react-hexgrid';
export default function App() {
    const hexagons: Hex[] = HexagonGenerator.hexagon({radius: 3});
}
```
