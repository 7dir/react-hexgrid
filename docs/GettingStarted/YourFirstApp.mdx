# Your First App

Note: Make sure you've installed `react-hexgrid` first!  Check out Introduction if you haven't.

## Step 1: Create a new React app

Since `react-hexgrid` is just a component library, it doesn't care what you use to init your React app.  I'm partial to vite:
```bash
npx create vite@latest my-hexgrid-app -- --template react-swc-ts
```

It doesn't matter if you use TypeScript or SWC - that's just my personal preference.

## Step 2: Install `react-hexgrid`

```bash
npm install @aaronzshey/react-hexgrid
```

### Step 3: Write your first hexagon!

In `App.tsx`, delete all the random code and replace it with this:

```tsx
import { HexGrid, Hexagon } from '@aaronzshey/react-hexgrid';
export default function App() {
  <HexGrid style={{width: "100vw", height: "100vh"}}>
    <Hexagon q={0} r={0} s={0} cellStyle={{fill: "red"}}/>
    </HexGrid>
}
```

Run the app with `npm run dev` or your preferred package manager, and you should see a red hexagon in the middle of your screen.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={BasicHexagonStory.Primary} />
</Canvas>

### Step 4: Understanding how it works

The HexGrid component exports a simple SVG element with a couple of default props, such as viewbox.  The Hexagon component
can accept all sorts of props, but the required ones are q, r, and s - the coordinates.
